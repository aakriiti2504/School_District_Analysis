# School_District_Analysis
## Background: 

Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district is responsible for 
analyzing information from a variety of resources and in a variety of formats. In this role she has a task of 
preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reportings and presesntation to provide
insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used for informd discussions and 
strategic decisions at the school and district level. 

## Goals:

I will be helping Maria analyze data on student funding and students standardized test scores. 
I am given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. 
my task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis will assist the school board and the superintendent
 in making decisions regarding the school budget and priorities. For this task, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act(FERPA) of 1974 is 
taken into consideration as it protects the  privacy of student education records. This law applies to all school that receive funds 
under an applicable program of the US Department of Education. The data is to be treated with utmost confidentiality to protect the students I am 
reporting on. 

## Tools used:

Maria advises to download and install a software calle Anaconda, a free open source distribution 
software for over 1500 packages, to perform the analysis. She has also provide some instructions and video tutorials. 
The analysis of school data will be done using the package 'Jupyter Notebook'.
In essence, Jupyter Notebook is to Anaconda what Microsoft Word is to Microsoft Office. Anaconda packages support the Python an R 
programming languages for datatscience, machine learning and data processing and so on. Here we will be using Python.
